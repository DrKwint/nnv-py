# Installation

Required libraries:
```
coinor-libcbc-devlib libclang-dev
```

On Ubuntu, these libraries can be installed with `apt-get`.

1. Activate your virtualenv

2. `cd` to `nnv-py/`

3. Run `python setup.py install` which will compile nnv-py with link time optimization and install the library in your virtualenv. It will take a minute or two to run.
